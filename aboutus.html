Since 1941, Jews from all across Europe have been gathered and forced into <br>
concentration camps where they faced the harshest forms of torture. Adolf Hitler, <br>
the German Nazi's dictator, used the Jews as a scapegoat as a reason for many faults. <br>
In concentration camps, the Jews were forced into rough labor, gas chambers, and <br>
experimented upon, just to name a few.</h1>
